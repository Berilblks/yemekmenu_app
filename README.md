# Food Menu Application Enhanced with Flutter

This project is a multi-platform mobile application developed using Dart and Flutter to display and manage food menus digitally.

## About the Project

This project was undertaken to create a dynamic, cross-platform mobile application for displaying, managing, and categorizing food menus, allowing me to facilitate, digitize, and improve my skills in modern mobile development.

    -- Cross-Platform Architecture: The application is built once using **Flutter** and **Dart**, allowing it to run natively on both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies

  -- Main Language : Dart (The primary programming language for Flutter development.)
  -- Framework : Flutter SDK (Used for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications.)
